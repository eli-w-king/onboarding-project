# Fixed MCP Integration

I've created a completely redesigned solution to address the connection issues:

## What Was Fixed:

1. **Direct Connection to Blender**: The new bridge connects directly to the Blender MCP server on port 1234 (the default), eliminating the intermediate proxy layer that was causing connection issues.

2. **Response Formatting**: Properly formats responses to match what your UI expects, ensuring proper display in the UI.

3. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages that help diagnose connection issues.

4. **API Key Validation**: Still validates your API key while allowing direct Blender code execution.

5. **Auto-Browser Opening**: Automatically opens the browser to the correct URL when started.

## How to Use:

1. Run the fixed script:
   ```bash
   ./run_fixed_mcp.sh
   ```

2. This will:
   - Start the official Blender MCP server
   - Start the fixed direct bridge
   - Open your browser to http://localhost:3002

3. In Blender:
   - Open the BlenderMCP tab in the sidebar (press N)
   - Click "Connect to Claude"

4. In your web UI:
   - Enter your API key as usual
   - Start sending Python code to Blender!

## Technical Details:

- The new implementation uses a direct socket connection to the Blender MCP server (port 1234)
- Eliminates the need for the WebSocket proxy layer
- Properly formats responses to match what your UI expects
- Uses a more reliable connection method

## Troubleshooting:

If you still have connection issues:

1. Make sure Blender is running and the addon is enabled
2. Verify that you've clicked "Connect to Claude" in the BlenderMCP tab
3. Check that no other services are using ports 1234 or 3002
4. If needed, restart all components by running the script again

Enjoy your improved and reliable MCP integration!
